This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: failure to explicitly handle null or undefined values passed as arguments to a function. The `bug.js` file contains the faulty code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that robustly manages null and undefined inputs.  The issue is prevalent and can lead to unexpected function behavior or runtime errors.  The solution emphasizes the importance of explicit null checks to prevent these scenarios.
